      <p>Alan Turing was a pioneering computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>Turing worked at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britainâ€™s codebreaking centre during World War II. He played a pivotal role in breaking the German Enigma code, which significantly contributed to the Allied victory.</p>
      <p>In 1952, Turing was prosecuted for homosexual acts in the UK, which led to his tragic death in 1954. In 2009, he received a posthumous apology from the British government, and in 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon.</p>
